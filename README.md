# ðŸŒ¡ Temp Conversion
A repository for allocating a temperature conversion system produced with the C programming language.

The system is divided into 4 files. One simply to store all the necessary menus and headers. Since the system can be run by users in two languages, a file takes care of the choice. Another file develops all the conversion between temperatures in both languages. Finally, the last file checks whether the user wants to perform another conversion or leave the system.
